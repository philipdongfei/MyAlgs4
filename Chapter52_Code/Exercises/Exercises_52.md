no is th ti fo al go pe to co to th ai of th pa
are inserted in that order into an initially empty trie (do not draw null links).

5.2.2 Draw the TST that results when the keys
no is th ti fo al go pe to co to th ai of th pa
are inserted in that order into an initially empty TST.

are inserted in that order into an initially empty trie (do not draw null links).

5.2.4 Draw the TST that results when the keys

are inserted in that order into an initially empty TST.

5.2.5 Develop nonrecursive versions of TrieST and TST.

5.2.6 Implement the following API, for a StringSET data type:
public class StringSET
StringSET()       *create a string set*
void add(String key)   *put key into the set*
void delete(String key) *remove key from the set*
boolean contains(String key)  *is key in the set?*
boolean isEmpty()  *is the set empty?*
int size()   *number of keys in the set*
int toString() *string representation of the set*
