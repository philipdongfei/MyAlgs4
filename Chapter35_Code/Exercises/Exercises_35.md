##Book Exercises

3.5.1 Implement SET and HashSET as "wrapper class" clients of ST and HashST, respectively (provide dummy values and ignore them).

3.5.2 Develop a SET implementation SequentialSearchSET by starting with the code for SequentialSearchSET and eliminating all of the code involving values.

3.5.3 Develop a SET implementation BinarySearchSET by starting with the code for BinarySearchSET and eliminating all of the code involving values.

3.5.4 Develop classes HashSTint and HashSTdouble for maintaining sets of keys of primitive int and double types, respectively. (Convert generics to primitive types in the code of LinearProbingHashST.)

3.5.5 Develop classes STint and STdouble for maintaining ordered symbol tables where keys are primitive int and double types, respectively. (Convert generics to primitive types in the code of RedBlackBST.) Test your solution with a version of SparseVector as a client.

3.5.6 Develop classes HashSETint and HashSETdouble for maintaining sets of keys of primitive int and double types, respectively. (Eliminate code involving values in your solution to EXERCISE 3.5.4.)

3.5.7 Develop classes SETint and SETdouble for maintaining ordered sets of keys of primitive int and double types, respectively.(Eliminate code involving values in your solution to EXERCISE 3.5.5.)

3.5.8 Modify LinearProbingHashST to keep duplicate keys in the table. Return any value associated with the given key for get(), and remove all items in the table that have keys equal to the given key for delete().

3.5.9 Modify BST to keep duplicate keys in the tree. Return any value associated with the given key for get(), and remove all nodes in the tree that have keys equal to the given key for delete().
