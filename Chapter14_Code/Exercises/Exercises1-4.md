1.4.1 Show that the number of different triples that can be chosen from N items is precisely N(N-1)(N-2)/6. *Hint*: Use mathematical induction.

**Answer**:$y_k$ 

$$ C_N^3 = \frac{N!}{3!(N-3)!} $$

1.4.2 Modify **ThreeSum** to work properly even when the *int* values are so large that adding two of them might cause overflow.

1.4.3 Modify **DoublingTest** to use StdDraw to produce plots like the standard and log-log plots int the text, rescaling as necessary so that the plot always fills a substantial portion of the window.
