##Book Exercises

5.3.1 Develop a brute-force substring search implementation Brute, using the same API as ALGORITHM 5.6.

5.3.2 Give the dfa[][] array for the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm for the pattern A A A A A A A A A, and draw the DFA, in the style of the figures in the text.

5.3.3 Give the dfa[][] array for the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm for the pattern A B R A C A D A B R A, and draw the DFA, in the style of the figures in the text.

5.3.4 Write an efficient method that takes a string txt and an integer M as arguments and returns the position of the first occurrence of M consecutive blanks in the string, txt.length if there is no such occurrence. Estimate the number of character compares used by your method, on typical text and in the worst case.

5.3.5 Develop a brute-force substring search implementation BruteForceRL that processes the pattern from right to left (a simplified version of ALGORITHM 5.7).

5.3.6 Give the right[] array computed by the constructor in ALGORITHM 5.7 for the pattern A B R A C A D A B R A.

5.3.7 Add to our brute-force implementation of substring search a count() method to count occurrences and a searchAll() method to print all occurrences.

5.3.8 Add to KMP a count() method to count occurrences and a searchAll() method to print all occurrences.
