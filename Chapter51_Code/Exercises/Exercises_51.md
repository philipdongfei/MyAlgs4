5.1.1 Develop a sort implementation that counts the number of different key values, then uses a symbol table to apply key-indexed counting to sort the array.(This method is not for use when the number of different key values is large.)

*Solution:* KeyIndexCounting.java

5.1.2 Give a trace for LSD string sort for the keys.

5.1.3 Give a trace of MSD string sort for the keys.
no is th ti fo al go pe to co to th ai of th pa

5.1.4 Give a trace of 3-way string quicksort for the keys
no is th ti fo al go pe to co to th ai of th pa

5.1.5 Give a trace for MSD string sort for the keys

5.1.6 Give a trace of 3-way string quicksort for the keys

5.1.7 Develop an implementation of key-indexed counting that makes use of an array of Queue objects.

5.1.8 Give the number of characters examined by MSD string sort and 3-way string quicksort for a file of N keys a, aa, aaa, aaaa, aaaaa,...

5.1.9 Develop an implementation of LSD string sort that works for variable-length strings.

5.1.10 What is the total number of characters examined by 3-way string quicksort when sorting N fixed-length strings (all of length W), in the worst case?

N*W
